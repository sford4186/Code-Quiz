# Code-Quiz

The goal of this assignment is to create an interactive timed multiple-choice coding quiz using the three fundamental coding blocks - HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  It should feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive.

What I plan to accomplish:
1. When the user cicks the started button, a timer will begin and a question will appear
2. When the question is answered, another question will appear.
3. If the question is answered incorrectly, the time is subtracted from the clock.
4. When the game is over, initials and score will be saved in local storage.
